Recently I've started the development of a C++ game engine called macgyver (named due to it's bodged together nature).

My journey to beginning Macgvyer is a long one, which started with my A-Level Coursework, where I decided to create

a pokemon inspired game using C# and SDL (there was a lot of `unsafe` being used). It didn't entirely work but it

gave me an interest in creating game engines. So after a few failed attempts, here I am now taking the lessons learnt

from previous project, and (perhaps more importantly) less dread at refactoring and documentation into this project.
