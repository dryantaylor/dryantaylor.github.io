Recently I've started the development of a C++ game engine called macgyver (named due to it's bodged together nature).

My journey to beginning Macgvyer is a long one, which started with my A-Level Coursework, where I decided to create

a pokemon inspired game using C# and SDL (there was a lot of `unsafe` being used). It didn't entirely work but it

gave me an interest in creating game engines. So after a few failed attempts, here I am now taking the lessons learnt

from previous project, and (perhaps more importantly) less dread at refactoring and documentation into this project.



To any would be readers please bear in mind the first sentance, this project isn't meant as a tutorial or an example

of good practices. Instead a place for me to experiment, have fun, and (to say the silent part for every game engine

dev) be one of the hip kids who gets to say they use their own engine.




With that in mind, to anyone left I hope you enjoy reading.
